## Description
This was my first venture into programming the Arduino LCD. The game allows the player to move around the screen to avoid asteroids or shoot them by clicking the joystick. It uses no special characters or libraries except for ***LiquidCrystal***, which comes with the Arduino IDE.

If you would like to see a more complex LCD project, see [LCD Koi Fish][10].

To see the game in action, see the video below!
